## What is Webs?

Webs is a full-stack, component-based framework for building modern web applications. It combines a simple, object-oriented component model with a powerful set of built-in features, allowing you to build everything from simple landing pages to complex, data-driven applications with ease.

It is a **"universal" framework**, meaning you write your component code once, and it can be run on both the server and the client. This enables a powerful Server-Side Rendering (SSR) model out of the box.

### Core Features

- **Sub-14kB Footprint**: A minimal gzipped footprint for the client-side runtime, engineered for near-instant loads.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Pre-renders pages on the server for fast initial loads and excellent SEO, then seamlessly "hydrates" into a full Single-Page Application (SPA).
- **Simple Component Model**: Build your UI with plain JavaScript objects that encapsulate state, logic, and markup.
- **Integrated Tooling**: A zero-configuration development environment with a dev server, Hot Module Replacement (HMR), and asset bundling.
- **Next-Gen Styling**: Deep, component-scoped integration with the powerful **Tailwind CSS v4 engine**.
- **Server Actions**: A secure, seamless way to call server-side logic (like database queries) directly from your client-side components.
- **Built-in Database**: Includes a ready-to-use SQLite database layer with a simple, version-based migration system.
- **Full Authentication**: Comes with helpers and API endpoints for session management and user authentication out of the box.
- **File-based Routing**: Intuitive routing that automatically maps files in your `src/app` directory to URL routes.
